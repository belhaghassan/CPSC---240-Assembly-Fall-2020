//Message to students of assembly programming.

//This program began with the intention of creating a program that demonstrates how to set the 
//state of the input stream to a 'good' state a failed state.  I intended to use the standard 
//three assembly statements to clear the failed state, namely:
//     mov rax,0
//     mov rdi,[stdin]
//     call clearerr
//The mystery is that when the program was finished I found out that it was performing correctly
//and that I had not used the 3 instructions to set the input stream (buffer) to good state.

//In conclusion, this project kind of failed.   It does not show the use of clearing the input
//stream generally known as stdin.



//In the future I will be looking for another program to demonstrate clearing of the input stream.
