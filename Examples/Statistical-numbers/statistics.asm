;Program name: Statistical Numbers
;Programming languages: C++ and X86
;Date of last modification: 2019-Sep-08
;Files in the program: stats.cpp, statistics.asm, run.sh
;Status: Testing has been successful
;Future: Separate some of the functionality in statistics.asm into one, or two, or more files containing functions.

;Declare the names of function defined outside of this file that will be called from within this file.

extern printf
extern getchar
extern stdin
extern clearerr
