# ClockSpeed

This repository contains a complete set of programs that allow the user to obtain the base clock speed
of an Intel processor. This program may fail if the users processor brand information does not contain an
@ sign as that is used to determine the location of the clock speed.

If you are looking for purely the function responsible for returning the float value representing the clock speed,
clock_speed.asm is responsible for that.
